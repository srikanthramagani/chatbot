# Chatbot

## Project Overview

Chatbot is a Flask-based web application that provides a conversational interface, file summarization, and PDF compression capabilities. It uses the Google Gemini API for generating responses and summaries, NLTK for text preprocessing, and PyPDF2 for handling PDFs. The application features a modern, animated web interface built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### Features
- **Conversational Chat**: Responds to user queries using a local dataset or the Gemini API, with responses limited to 200 characters for concise, readable output.
- **File Upload and Summarization**: Supports uploading CSV files (to load Q&A datasets) and PDF files (for summarization), with summaries capped at 200 characters.
- **PDF Compression**: Compresses uploaded PDFs and allows users to download the optimized versions.
- **User Interface**: A visually appealing design with gradient backgrounds, animated message transitions, and a responsive layout.
